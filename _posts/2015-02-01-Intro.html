Composition as a metaphor for art.<a href="http://www.metaphorandart.com/articles/historycomposition.html">http://www.metaphorandart.com/articles/historycomposition.html</a><br>
Why is art and art history important. It's consistent, predictive and repetitive. Everyday deconstructivism in <a href="http://www.mtv.com.au/sites/default/files/styles/vimn_image_embed/public/mtv_au/galleries/large/2015/06/02/dogshow3.jpg?itok=VZ8Yno4P">pet grooming</a><br>

New Media Art, where art and techonology (often times involving web) jon force to create new metaphor, and shapes new culture.

<p>Chris O'Shea is a toy designer based in London. O'Sheaâ€™s work often incorporates alternative uses of technology to encourage people to relinquish the learnt behaviour of adulthood and reconnect with the wonderment of youth. Through his reprogramming and reassignment he hopes togive audiences fresh new perspectives, allowing them to re-evaluate their everyday surroundings. Just as a torch shines light into a darkened space to bring things into focus, this work uses the torch as a way of looking into the workings of a modern museum.</p>

<h2>HTML5</h2>
<p>The primary one is consistent, defined error handling. As you know, HTML purposely supports 'tag soup', or the ability to write malformed code and have it corrected into a valid document. The problem is that the rules for doing this aren't written down anywhere. When a new browser vendor wants to enter the market, they just have to test malformed documents in various browsers (especially IE) and reverse-engineer their error handling. If they don't, then many pages won't display correctly (estimates place roughly 90% of pages on the net as being at least somewhat malformed). So, HTML5 is attempting to discover and codify this error handling, so that browser developers can all standardize and greatly reduce the time and money required to display things consistently. As well, long in the future after HTML has died as a document format, historians may still want to read our documents, and having a completely defined parsing algorithm will greatly aid this.
</p>

<p>The secondary goal of HTML5 is to develop the ability of the browser to be an application platform, via HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Many elements have been added directly to the language that are currently (in HTML4) Flash or JS-based hacks, such as canvas, video, and audio. Useful things such as Local Storage (a js-accessible browser-built-in key-value database, for storing information beyond what cookies can hold), new input types such as date for which the browser can expose easy user interface (so that we don't have to use our js-based calendar date-pickers), and browser-supported form validation will make developing web applications much simpler for the developers, and make them much faster for the users (since many things will be supported natively, rather than hacked in via javascript).

<h5>And why responsive design?</h5>
<p>Well, the more you browse websites on iPhones and Android powered handsets, the more apparent the reasons become. It's a tedious and frustrating task to constantly zoom in and out of page areas to see them at a readable size and then move the page left and right to read sentences that are hanging out of the viewport just enough to be annoying, whilst not inadvertently tapping a link you don't want to. Surely we can do better!
</p>
<p>One day, we will be able to build sites like these. But it will take quite a while.So, let's conclude our introduction with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1oZhEIrer4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1oZhEIrer4</a>
