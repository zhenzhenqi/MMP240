    <h2>Fundations of Typography</h2>

    <p>We'll go into more depth on type classification later on in this course. There are tens of thousands of typefaces in each of these categories that are available from the many type foundries and type sellers and no one can be familiar with all of them, not even me. But if you can learn to distinguish the important differences and characteristics of basic type styles, it will help you make smart choices in designing your projects. Being a good type detective and learning to see the different types of Serif and Sans Serif is the first step.</p>
    <br><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Design-Design-Skills-tutorials/Display-type-vs-text-type/106698/121848-4.html">Display Type vs. Text Type</a>
    <p>An important distinction in typography is the difference between Text Type and Display Type. Here's what you need to remember. Text Type is type that is designed to be read in large quantities at small sizes. For example, the bulk of the text in any newspaper, magazine, or book is Text Type. It's also called Body Type or Body Copy. Display type, on the other hand, is type that 14 point or larger, and it's typically used in small quantities for emphasis and effect.</p>
    <br><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Design-Design-Skills-tutorials/Kerning-kerning-pairs/106698/121861-4.html">Kerning and kerning pairs</a>
    <p>Kerning is the adjustment of the spaces between two specific letters. It's different from tracking, which is the adjustment of the spaces between a group of letters. The goal of kerning is to create a consistent rhythm of space between characters which helps readability. At text sizes, you don't have to adjust the kerning because the type designer has already done that for you. There are thousands of carefully calculated spaces between every possible letter combination already built into a typeface by its creator. These are called kerning pairs.</p>
    <br><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Design-Design-Skills-tutorials/Tracking-leading/106698/121862-4.html">Tracking and Leading</a>
    <p>Tracking is an overall adjustment of space applied equally to a word, a line, or a passage of text. Leading is the space between lines measured from the baseline to baseline. Tracking and leading can both affect the overall typographic color or tonal weight of the page and its legibility.</p>
    <br><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Design-Design-Skills-tutorials/Exploring-variations-type-alignment/106698/121863-4.html">Type Alignment</a>
    <p>There are five possible kinds of alignment, Flush left, Flush right, Justified, Centered, and Random, also known as asymmetrical. These are few more terms to add your type vocabulary. When lines of type are aligned on the left, we say it is flush left. Notice that the words are uneven or ragged on the right that is rag right. This is a common form of typesetting because we read from left to right and flush left type allows us to find our place on the next line more easily.</p>
