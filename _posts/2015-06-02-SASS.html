<p>what’s SASS?</p>

<div>
    <blockquote>
        Sass is a meta-language on top of CSS that’s used to describe the style of a document cleanly and structurally, with more power than flat CSS allows. Sass both provides a simpler, more elegant syntax for CSS and implements various features that are useful for creating manageable stylesheets.

    <p>So while normal CSS doesn’t yet allow things like variables, mixins (reusable blocks of styles), and other goodies, Sass provides a syntax that does all of that and more—enabling “super functionality” in addition to your normal CSS. It then translates (or compiles) that syntax into regular ol’ CSS files via a command-line program or web-framework plugin.
        <br>
        <br> More specifically, Sass is an extension of CSS3, and its SCSS (“Sassy CSS”) syntax—which we’ll talk about in just a moment—is a superset of CSS3. Meaning, any valid CSS3 document is a valid SCSS document as well. This is integral to Sass being something you can “ease into.” Getting started with Sass syntax is painless, and you can use as little or as much as you’d like. Which also means converting an existing stylesheet from CSS to SCSS can be done in stages, as you learn and pick up more of Sass’s functionality.
        <br>
        <br> Later, when you’ve become fluent with Sass (and it won’t take long), it really does feel like a natural extension of CSS—as if it’s filling holes we all wish were filled by the CSS spec itself. This is why, once I started using Sass, I never once thought it was awkward or laborious—it just feels like CSS should feel. Once you try it, you’ll likely stick with it permanently.
        <br>
        <br> Furthermore, Sass is helping CSS get better. By fast-tracking certain features that aren’t currently possible without the help of a preprocessor, it’s giving CSS authors real-world implementation and feature experimentation. When and if it makes sense, certain Sass functionality could very well inform future CSS specifications.</p>

    <h2>A SASS workflow</h2>
    
    <h4>Working With Color Variables:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Create color variables according to your design file’s color palette</li>
        <li>Create color-main and color-backgrounds variable</li>
        <li>Replace body color and background color with above variables</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Working with Font Variables:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Select three fonts in google fonts, i.e., Roboto+Slab|Merriweather|Oswald|Bree+Serif</li>
        <li>Compare headline vs paragraph style</li>
        <li>Click USE, check load speed, and select font weight</li>
        <li>Pick css import and paste link on top of the css style sheet</li>
        <li>Specify font-main and font-highlight variable</li>
        <li>Set body to font-main and h1 to h6 to font-hightlight</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Working with font Color Variables:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Create color-headlines</li>
        <li>Replace h1 to h6 color to above variable</li>
    </ol>

 1.  2.    Nested Style Rule to sections that have nested structure, i.e.., Media Section (ordered lists) 1. define margin, padding for main level 2. define specific margin, border, color, font size for nested level   Break CSS into functional modular code: (a great and logical way to organize styling code) 1. create variables.scss 1. 1transfer all color variables, theme color variables and font variables into above file. 2. add @import "variables.scss" into style.scss  2. create base.scss 1. transfer html, body, container, h1 to h6 code in this file 2. add @import "base.scss" into style.scss 3. create modules folder 4. inside modules, create media.scss 1. transfer all media code inside 2. add @import "modules/media.scss" into styles.scss 5. download normalize.css and import it to styles.scss   Work with Mixin (js like functions) 1.create backgrounds.scss file and link to style.scss. Work on nested styling for the section. 2. add “class = background” to jumbotron section 3. create mixins.scss in sass folder and link to style.scss 4. create background image mixin and add to jumbotron 5. in html below buttons section add:
<section class="bridge background">
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Bridge Background</h1>
    </div>
</section>
6. add bridge mixin in background.scss file Working with @extend method 1. create inteface.scss and link to styles.scss 2. implement default button style and apply in html 3. implement additional classes 4. switch to @extend method Referencing Parent Selector 1. in media.scss, add &:hover and &:last-of-type 2. create clarify mixing in mixing.scss 3. add mixing in media.scss
