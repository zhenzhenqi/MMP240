    <p>what’s SASS?</p>
    <blockquote>
        Sass is a meta-language on top of CSS that’s used to describe the style of a document cleanly and structurally, with more power than flat CSS allows. Sass both provides a simpler, more elegant syntax for CSS and implements various features that are useful for creating manageable stylesheets.

    <p>So while normal CSS doesn’t yet allow things like variables, mixins (reusable blocks of styles), and other goodies, Sass provides a syntax that does all of that and more—enabling “super functionality” in addition to your normal CSS. It then translates (or compiles) that syntax into regular ol’ CSS files via a command-line program or web-framework plugin.
        <br>
        <br> More specifically, Sass is an extension of CSS3, and its SCSS (“Sassy CSS”) syntax—which we’ll talk about in just a moment—is a superset of CSS3. Meaning, any valid CSS3 document is a valid SCSS document as well. This is integral to Sass being something you can “ease into.” Getting started with Sass syntax is painless, and you can use as little or as much as you’d like. Which also means converting an existing stylesheet from CSS to SCSS can be done in stages, as you learn and pick up more of Sass’s functionality.
        <br>
        <br> Later, when you’ve become fluent with Sass (and it won’t take long), it really does feel like a natural extension of CSS—as if it’s filling holes we all wish were filled by the CSS spec itself. This is why, once I started using Sass, I never once thought it was awkward or laborious—it just feels like CSS should feel. Once you try it, you’ll likely stick with it permanently.
        <br>
        <br> Furthermore, Sass is helping CSS get better. By fast-tracking certain features that aren’t currently possible without the help of a preprocessor, it’s giving CSS authors real-world implementation and feature experimentation. When and if it makes sense, certain Sass functionality could very well inform future CSS specifications.</p>

    <h2>A SASS workflow</h2>
    
    <h4>Working With Color Variables:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In SASS folder, create style.scss file and input the following css:
            {% highlight css%}
                html {
                    font-size: 62.5%;
                }

                body {
                    margin: 0;
                    padding: 0;
                    font-size: 1.8em;
                    font-family: 'Helvetica', sans-serif;
