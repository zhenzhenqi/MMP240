    <p>More and more web tools and your work flow are moving to the command line. Tools like <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a>, <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a>, <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>/<a href="http://compass-style.org/" target="_blank">Compass</a> and many more now live on the command line. While some of them have GUI interfaces, most stay where they began.</p>
    <p>If you are fairly new to web development, and you are looking to take your skills to the next level, the command line is going to become your friend(or foe) fairly quickly. It is something that is pretty new to me as well. So lets take a look at some of the most basic unix commands and how you might use them. And in future posts we will explore more complex commands and usages. <strong>Please note that these commands are for a unix environment, most of these will not work for windows, sorry.</strong> </p>
    <p>ps. If you are not familiar with unix, take a look at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">wikipedia</a> article to get a better understanding of the environment you will be working in!

    <h3>ls</h3>
    <p><code class=" language-markup">ls</code> is used to list the directory. This is pretty simple, but useful. </p>
    <pre class=" language-markup">
            <code class=" language-markup">
            $ ls
                Adobe Acrobat XI Pro	Downloads		Pictures
                Applications		    Dropbox			Public
                Box Documents		    Library			Samsung
                Desktop			        Movies			Sites
                Documents		        Music
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p>There are some useful flags that come along with <code class=" language-markup">ls</code>. <code class=" language-markup">ls -l</code> will print out the directory in long format. Using the <code class=" language-markup">ls -a</code> tag will print out any <code class=" language-markup">.</code> files. Flags can be used like <code class=" language-markup">ls -l -a</code>, or if you are using more than one flag, you can string them together. Like such <code class=" language-markup">ls -la</code>. Want to know what is in a directory which out moving into it? <code class=" language-markup">ls -la Sites/</code>, this will list the files in that directory. </p>
    <h3>pwd</h3>
    <p>This is a simple command, it just prints out the present working directory, so if you get lost you can use <code class=" language-markup">pwd</code> and it will let you know where you currently are in the system.</p>
    <h3>cd</h3>
    <p>Listing the directory is no good unless you can go somewhere. That is where <code class=" language-markup">cd</code> comes in. <code class=" language-markup">cd</code> is used to change directories. Something to note is that when you start up a new terminal you are in your home folder. This will usually be <code class=" language-markup">/Users/yourname</code> using the <code class=" language-markup">ls</code> or <code class=" language-markup">pwd</code> you can get an idea of where you are and where you want to go. It is as simple as using the <code class=" language-markup">cd</code> like such <code class=" language-markup">cd Desktop/Projects/</code>, to move back a directory you would use <code class=" language-markup">..</code>
    </p>
    <pre class=" language-markup">
            <code class=" language-markup">
                $ cd Desktop/Projects
                $ pwd
                $ /Users/Rchristiani/Desktop/Projects
                $ cd ..
                $ pwd
                $ /Users/Rchristiani/Desktop
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>You can also use the <code class=" language-markup">..</code> in a more complex manner, something like:</p>
    <pre class=" language-markup">
            <code class="language-markup">
                $ pwd
                $ /Users/Rchristiani/Desktop/Projects/SomeSite/js
                $ cd ../../
                $ pwd
                $ /Users/Rchristiani/Desktop/Projects
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>Also if you know that using <code class=" language-markup">cd ../..</code> gets you to a certain point you can then go into a folder, <code class=" language-markup">cd ../../newsite</code>. If you are not sure what the directory you need to into is called, double tapping the tab key will work like the <code class=" language-markup">ls</code> command.</p>
    <p>These are a few of the most basic commands you might use. Next time I will look into at some more advanced commands and usage! </p>
